# Reinforcement Learning Pipeline using dm_control(MuJoCo based) and PPO algorithm (implemented in Tensorflow)

Install dm_control using below command. You might also have to install MuJoCo.
Ultimate objective of this project is to use RL-trained actor weights on the ESP32, to make a reindeer-shaped toy walk properly.

```bash
pip install dm_control
```

testing on : Tensorflow 2.11.0, dm_control 1.0.16
